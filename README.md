# FitEOS

A Python package for fitting equations. In particular, this package was written with equation of state information in mind. Where functions that describe pressure as a function of volume are fit with experimental data (with error bars) to determine the equation of state parameters.

## Installation

To install from ``pip`` do
```
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/lanl/fiteos
```

To install from source do
```
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

There are two ways to use FitEOS: a command line interface or through library calls.
Here, we go through examples of both usages.

There is an executable to perform fits from a command-line interface.
To fit a third-order Burch-Murnaghan equation of state can be fit with
```
fiteos_fit \
    --input-file fiteos/tests/data/clinoenstatite.csv \
    --eos bm3 \
    --parameters vo:400.0:0.0:None:True ko:134.0:0.0:None:True kp:4.0:None:None:True
```

Similarily, a second-order Burch-Murnaghan equation of state can be fit with
```
fiteos_fit \
    --input-file fiteos/tests/data/clinoenstatite.csv \
    --eos bm2 \
    --parameters vo:400.0:0.0:None:True ko:134.0:0.0:None:True kp:4.0:None:None:False
```
The option ``--input-file`` is the path to a CSV file.
The option ``--eos`` is the name of the equation to fit, in this case ``bm3``; see ``--help`` for more options.
The option ``--parameters`` is a list of parameters and each parameter is five values separated by ``:``; the five values corresponds to the parameter name, initial value, minimum, maximum, and whether the parameter is varied in the fit (``True`` or ``False``).
The user may give ``None`` if they wish to not use a minimium or maximum.
For example, the parameter ``vo:400.0:0.0:None:True`` corresponds to ``vo`` (reference volume) with a minimum of 0.0, no maximum, and it is varied in the fit.

Alternatively, the user can call the library directly in a script.
Here, we go through an example.
First import the modules we will use
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from fiteos import equations
from fiteos import solver
```

FitEOS has functions for reading CSV files, an example is included with this repository with columns for ``p`` (pressure), ``sigma_p`` (pressure standard deviation), ``v`` (volume), and ``sigma_v`` (volume variance).
The following can be used to load the example file
```
# set data file
input_file = "fiteos/tests/data/clinoenstatite.csv"

# read pressure and volume data
x, sigma_x, y, sigma_y = io.read_csv(
                input_file,
                x=eqn.x_name, sigma_x="sigma_{}".format(eqn.x_name),
                y=eqn.y_name, sigma_y="sigma_{}".format(eqn.y_name))
```

Next, we load the equaiton to minimize
```
# equation to minimize
eqn = equations.equations[equations.bm3.BM3Equation.name]()
```

Next, we can create the solver and minimize
```
# set random seed
numpy.random.seed(0)

# initialize solver
s = solver.Solver(x=x, y=y, sigma_x=sigma_x, sigma_y=sigma_y, equation=eqn)

# initial parameters, minimums, maximums, and varying flag
parameters = {
    "vo" : (400.0, 0.0, None, True),
    "ko" : (134.0, 0.0, None, True),
    "kp" : (4.0, None, None, True),
}
for key, vals in parameters.items():
    s.set_parameter(key, value=vals[0], low=vals[1], high=vals[2], vary=vals[3])

# optimize
s.minimize(method="Nedler")
s.minimize(method="leastsq")
```

Finally, there are several plots that can accompany equations, and the follow displays the results
```
# set confidence interval
confidence_interval = 0.95

# plot
s.plot(**{"confidence_interval" : confidence_interval})
plt.show()
```

## Tests

To run unit tests do
```
python -m unittest discover -v -b
```
